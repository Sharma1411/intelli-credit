Based on the provided financial data, here's my analysis:

1. Overall financial health: Average
The company's financial health appears average due to limited information available. However, the presence of a stable net profit margin is a positive indicator.

2. Key strengths:
- The company has a stable net profit margin of 12%, which suggests its ability to maintain profitability.
- The average monthly revenue of 1.05 Crores indicates a consistent revenue stream.

3. Key risks:
- The lack of debt-related information makes it difficult to assess the company's leverage and debt servicing capabilities.
- There is no information available on the company's annual turnover for the last 3 years, which could indicate volatility or inconsistency in revenue growth.

4. Preliminary credit recommendation: Need More Info
Given the limited information available, I would require more data to make an informed credit decision.

5. Reason for my recommendation:
The reason for needing more information is that the provided data does not give a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance, debt position, and potential risks. Additional information on debt, annual turnover, and other key financial metrics would be necessary to assess the company's creditworthiness and make a more informed decision.
